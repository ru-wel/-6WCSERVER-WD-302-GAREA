GAREA - “Your Home Away From Home”

GAREA is a web application inspired by Airbnb that provides a platform for managing accommodations. The website is designed as an admin page, which allows administrators to add, view, edit, and delete properties, providing diverse travel and lifestyle options for users to browse and select from a variety of options.

The GAREA web application focuses on travel and lifestyle, offering an Airbnb-style platform for accommodation management. The admin-centric site enables the website administrators to manage a catalog of properties for short-term stays. It provides travelers with an easy way to find apartments, houses, and unique accommodations such as cabins and villas to suit various travel preferences.
